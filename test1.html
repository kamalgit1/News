<h2>Opinion: Will Milind Deora's exit eclipse Rahul Gandhi's Bharat Nyay Yatra?</h2>
<p>Milind Deoraâ€™s exit from the Congress party has marked an end of close 
    family ties between the Deoras and the Gandhis. Much like Jyotiraditya 
    Scindia, RPN Singh, Jitin Prasada, Ashok Tanwar, and others, Sonia Gandhi,
     Rahul Gandhi, and Priyanka Gandhi seemed to make no effort to retain Milind 
     Deora, who was once a close friend and business associate of Rahul Gandhi.</p>
